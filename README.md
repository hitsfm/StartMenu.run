# StartMenu.run

A "web" community built around a retro looking UI, Simulating the look and feel of "classic" OS.

This is where I will publish the code as I go along building my personal website http://startmenu.run

Goals:

A) Simulate the startup of classic OS. Have different "runtime" levels each offering unique set of features. 

B) Easy mode, Switch or menu system built around ShieldUI to bypass "shell" and load a graphical desktop/app.

C) Memberships, Forums, Files, And email hosting/management, Avoiding PHP and MySQL databases as much as possible.

D) To note, Not focused on a classic gaming web community, But needing an integration of various "virtual machines" That would respectfully run in the background to support/convert some old useful(ham radio calculator) apps to "web" apps. Frame it around ShieldUI. Access the apps from Web desktop GUI seamlessly with the rest of the system/web apps.

E)Figure out a functional Cut/Copy/Paste implementation. This does not make sense at the moment as the web browser has these features. In the future. I or anyone else may want to convert/compile this to a standalone app someday. Then it would make sense to implement the Cut/Copy/Paste menu functions within the site code. I will be including it in the Shield UI menu. But the function for now is blank.

E)Modify and repack JSlinux using SPLITIMG compiled utility, Win2k image to run WinXP basic apps with KernelEX, Integrate these apps into the web desktop. Frame the virtual machine apps with ShieldUI. JSlinux is remarkably fast and windows NT apps only take a few seconds(Up to 30 seconds) to load on my iPad Safari web browser! So this must be the way to go. The little HTML5 loader animation script That I use as a crude but effective mask, While performing various background loading. Is actually pleasant to look at while various tasks run and load.




Supported Web Server:

Just dump the files in your server public www directory. Modify code/site to suit your needs.

-All flavors of Apache, On Windows, Linux, Mac. 
-With web server configured to handle .wasm (I may end up offering the simple Apache modified configuration files if requested.)
